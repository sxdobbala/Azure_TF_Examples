# Azure Tenant Refresh (Azure Launchpad)

## What is it?

Launchpad is the audit-only security and compliance baseline that is being applied to all accounts (AWS) and subscriptions (Azure) in the Public Cloud. The first release provides initial visibility into account compliance by forwarding logs of policy violations to central logging systems. You as an owner of the account/subscription are required to triage and remediate any issues that Launchpad reveals. Launchpad will not correct identified security issues.

## Why do I need it?

Launchpad is necessary for all AWS and Azure accounts as it provides Enterprise Information Security a way to monitor the security of public cloud accounts. This is not intended to punish users for any identified security violations, but rather help remediate risks and validate that Optum Security Standards are being met.

Please visit [Public Cloud Security Controls](https://www.optumdeveloper.com/content/odv-optumdev/optum-developer/en/developer-centers/hosting/public-cloud/public-cloud-security-principles.html) on Optum Developer to learn more about securing public cloud accounts.

## How does it work?

Azure Launchpad works by creating an [Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about) namespace in the central management subscription for each tenant. Each subscription that is running Launchpad is configured to send their [activity logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-activity-logs) to the Event Hub namespace in their tenant's central management subscription. A Splunk forwarder VM is also created in the central management subscription to forward the events from the Event Hubs to Splunk SaaS.

Each individual subscription that gets Launchpad applied will have their subscription's activity logs sent to the central management subscription's Event Hub namespace (as described above) and will also have a set of policies added to their subscription. Currently, Launchpad uses [policy initiatives](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview#initiative-definition) to group policies. Policy compliance can be checked by going to the Azure portal, then to the Policy blade, and finally to Compliance.

## Developer Notes

### Onboarding new Tenants with Launchpad

The Commercial Cloud team must create a new subscription that will be the central management subscription in the tenant. The members of the Commercial Cloud team that need access to this tenant should have their secondary entids invited as guest users to this tenant. In order to create the Service Principals that are required for Launchpad, they must be assigned the `AppDev` role. Once this has happened, two Service Principals must be created.

The first Service Principal is used for creating the infrastructure in the central subscription. This Service Principal must have owner over the subscription. This Service Principal's credentials should then be added to Jenkins, scoped to this repo only. The credential ID for this Service Principal in Jenkins **must** contain the string `central_mgmt_id`. The other Service Principal that is needed is for Splunk. A Service Principal is needed that can read from the Event Hub that logs are sent to. This Service Principal needs access to the Key Vault that contains the Event Hub Namespace key that is required to read from the Event Hub (this handled by the Terraform code). This Service Principal can be created by using the `create_splunk_sp.sh` script in `/central_management_subscription/centralized_logging_splunk/`. Directions for running the script can be found in the `README.md` file in this directory. Take note of the output from running this script.

After the two Service Principals are created, the `Jenkinsfile` and `tenants.yml` should be updated with the details for this new tenant. Since Launchpad needs to run on the central management subscription first, we have to directly commit to master these changes with the `[ci]` commit message format that is used for single subscription runs (more details to follow). On the master branch update the tenant ID/Service Principal Object ID map in the `Jenkinsfile` with the Splunk Service Principal's object ID from the output of the `create_splunk_sp.sh` script. Next add the tenant ID and the central management's Service Principal credential ID to `tenants.yml` (see the existing tenants for the correct format). Finally, commit these changes directly to master and make sure your commit message is using the `[ci]` form, for example: `git commit -a -m "[ci] {'tenant':'new-tenant-id','subscription':'central-sub-sp-jenkins-cred-id'}"`. An example commit for a new tenant is [here](https://github.optum.com/CommercialCloud-EAC/azure_tenant_refresh/commit/9ecd6035b45f571f1661da3b12b37542db5a2622).

Committing to master will trigger a Launchpad run on the central management subscription in the tenant. Note, Launchpad will register the necessary resource providers in the subscription if they are not already. For example you may see `Resource provider 'Microsoft.Storage' used by this operation is not registered. We are registering for you.` if storage is not registered yet. Also note in the build that there will be two duplicate stages. This is expected since single account runs first run on the central subscription and then the target subscription. In this case those subscriptions are the same.

After the run has completed, the Splunk Forwarder can be configured. See the `README.md` file in the `/central_management_subscription/centralized_logging_splunk/` directory for details on this process.

Existing subscriptions can get Launchpad by following the directions [here](https://hubconnect.uhg.com/login.jspa?referer=%2Fgroups%2Fpeds-public-cloud%2Fblog%2F2018%2F06%2F21%2Fazure-launchpad-instructions). Newly provisioned subscription will automatically get Launchpad applied.

## EIS Security Endorsement

### Security

---

Launchpad assigns the following policies to all active subscriptions. These policies help to enforce the specified EIS mandates.
