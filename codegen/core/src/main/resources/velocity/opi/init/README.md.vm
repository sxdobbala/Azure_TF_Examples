$pound New OPI API - ${artifactId}
This is a new OPI API generated from Cloud Scaffolding that will be registered with the Payment Integrity API Catalog.

$pound$pound Getting Started

$pound$pound$pound Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

$pound$pound$pound$pound Self-discovery
You can use this Jenkins Pipeline Library method in order to easily publish your API to the Catalog. Simply add a new Global Pipeline Library to your Jenkins instance or Central folder with the following url: https://github.optum.com/opi-api/global-pipeline-library

If you do not already load in a pipeline library, then add the following line at the top of your `Jenkinsfile`:
```groovy
@Library('opi-library@v1.0') _
```

If you already have a library loaded, you can load multiple libraries with this syntax:
```groovy
@Library(['com.optum.jenkins.pipeline.library@v0.1.23','opi-library@v1.0']) _
```

Then add this step into your `Jenkinsfile`:
```groovy
glCatalogPublish jwtCredentialsId:"YOUR_JWT_CREDS"
```
`YOUR_JWT_CREDS` should point to a Jenkins credential id with your token and secret you were given on the Catalog Registration page.

Refer to [this documentation](https://github.optum.com/opi-api/catalog-discovery) for more information about the discovery service.

$pound$pound$pound$pound Properties file
One of the files that has been generated is the `apicatalog.json` file. This is necessary for your API to publish metadata to the API Catalog. You will need to fill in some parameters specific to your API

$pound$pound$pound$pound Manifest file
The `manifest.json` that was created is just a copy of the `json` body that you passed to codegen. This is not a part of your new API, but might be helpful to keep if you want to use it to create a new API with `codegen`

$pound$pound$pound$pound Swagger Documentation
This boiler plate also configures Swagger to work with the exposed API. If you run your project, go to `localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` to see the Swagger documentation. You can also see the `json` or `yml` if you browse to the `/v2/api-docs` endpoint.

$pound$pound$pound$pound OpenAPI Specification
This API's Swagger documentation already follows the [OpenAPI Spec](https://www.optumdeveloper.com/content/odv-optumdev/optum-developer/en/developer-centers/apis/documentation-and-other-resources/api-design-best-practices.html), which is required for all RESTful APIs at Optum.
