## Introduction
Thank you for your interest to contribute to the Cloud Scaffolding library of projects. The Cloud Scaffolding team welcomes contributions from the community.

By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to one of the maintainers found in the appropriate Readme.

## How to contribute
1. Create your own fork of the code

2. Do the changes in your fork

3. Create pull request to the **develop** branch
* If the change is related to one of the [Github issues][#Support Channels] for the service be sure to include the link in the pull request.
* Be sure you have followed the [code style](#style guides) for the project.
* Use descriptive Pull Request (PR) names
* If your PR is a WIP then prefix the title with \"WIP-{descriptive feature name}\"
     * ex/ \"WIP-MyAwesomeFeatureThatMakesStuffFromNothing\"
4.  A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one.
