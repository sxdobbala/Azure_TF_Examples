The python app type is a Flask-based application that uses uWSGI to deploy on Openshift/Mesos.

By default, the app is a simple "Hello World" example of how to create routes and return data using Flask. For info on how to extend this into a more complete application, check out the official Flask documentation:

http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/
