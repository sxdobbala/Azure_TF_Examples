# Overview 

The Transit Hub VPN supports Site-to-Site VPN connections to most locations and devices.

Please fill out the [VPN worksheet](media/OptumTransitHubVPNworksheet.docx) and attach it to a new Service Now ticket. Follow the [Service Now engagement](../../itsm/service-now-engagement.md) guide to submit a request to the DevOps Enablement networking team. The team will setup a discussion with the requestor to determine the best course of action.

The DevOps team will work with you and the point of contact on receiving VPN device to establish a connection, setup routing between the two networks, and implement any firewall changes that need to occur to allow the traffic to flow between the networks.
