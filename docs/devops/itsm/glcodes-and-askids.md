Within Optum each application is required to be registered in the [ASK Application Database](https://ask.optum.com/applications). ASK provides a way to document the lifecycle of the applications, their risk exposure, and many other details like technical and business contacts. This information is fed, in turn, to [Optum's CMDB](https://itsmreporting.uhc.com/cicentral/ci_central.aspx). A key component of any application registration is linking it to a General Ledger (GL) code. The GL code ties all expenses back to the application. Typically, and application's GL code is not the same as the GL code for the developer creating the application.

To request a GL code be assigned to your application you will want to first, register the application in the ASK Application Database, then speak with the application's Business Owner to develop some idea of which part of the business is going to pay for the application's expenses, and then send an email with this information to [Kaur, Prabhjot <prabhjot_kaur2@optum.com>](mailto:prabhjot_kaur2@optum.com)  and ["Greguson, Connor R" <connor.r.greguson@optum.com>](mailto:connor.r.greguson@optum.com) with the subject "New ASK ID - need GL mapped".
