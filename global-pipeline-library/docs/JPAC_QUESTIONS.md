Q: When can I get away with not doing smoke tests?
A: If it's not possible to perform smoke testing then you can get away with not having Smoke Testing; however, 
if it's possible to perform smoke testing then why not do so for every deployment in every environment? 

Q: What is the best tool for performance testing?
A: This will be technology stack dependent and could differ from team to team.  It is far more important that you have 
performance testing in place as part of your Continuous Delivery Pipeline than it is which tool you used.

Q: I am trying to test a service in a lesser used language (python, go, haskell), how do I do that?
A: TBD
