# Example Application  
The EHRLogic.zip is an outdated version of the application, for use as a reference point on how it works  
The Installation Guide.pdf is provided for informational purposes, it is a (draft) walkthrough for customers to help them install the application in a perpetual environment  
The application is provided without connection strings or user configuration (the installation guide walks through how to add them)  
The application will bootstrap the database once it runs (it will create the database and tables if it doesn't exist). This can take several minutes, so expect a slow load time when it is first run
