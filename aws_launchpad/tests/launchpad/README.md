# Tests

This directory contains integration tests for launchpad. The testing framework used is [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). On a pull request, all tests in this directory are run. Files with tests must be prefixed with test_ in order to be discovered. Test methods must also be prefixed with test_.

Any dependencies needed to run the tests should be placed in requirements.txt.
